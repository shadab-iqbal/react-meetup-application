# Meetup Application

This is a simple meetup application where users can see all the available current meetups, can add new meetup and also add a meetup to favorites.

This project was done to understand the usage of different react hooks like useEffect, createEffect, etc. To store meetups data, firebase real-time database has been used.

_Developed using React.js, and Firebase._
